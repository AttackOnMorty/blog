<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## Why

- Refactoring improves the design of software
- Refactoring makes software easier to understand
- Refactoring helps find bugs
- Refactoring helps program faster

## What

- Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it **easier to understand** and **cheaper to modify** without changing its observable behavior.
- Refactoring (verb): to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior.

## When

> The Rule of Three: Three strikes, then you refactor

### When to Refactor

- Opportunistic refactoring

  - Preparatory refactoring: Making it easier to add a feature
  - Comprehension refactoring: Making the code easier to understand
  - Litter-Pickup refactoring

- Planned refactoring

  - Long-Term refactoring
  - Refactoring during code reviews

### When Not to Refactor

- No need to modify it
- It's easier to rewrite it
