## Two bottlenecks

### The bandwidth of the human brain to receive information

- 100-200 bits of information are received in 1 second, about 12-25 Chinese characters.

### The speed at which the human eye recognizes information

- When reading text, the images seen by the eyes need to be recognized by the brain in order to be understood.
- The retina of the eye can only cover about 1 [degree](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)>) in front of the eye.

> How big is an angle of 1 degree?
>
> You straighten your arm and raise your index finger. The width of your index finger is about 1 degree angle. In other words, if you hold the book so far away, you can probably see 4 to 5 Chinese characters clearly at one time. If you hold the book closer, you can only see 3 characters.

Physiological limits cannot be changed, but they can be approached through training.

## How to train to break through bottlenecks

### Adjust book position

Since the effective viewing angle for reading is only 1 degree, placing the book further away from the habitual distance can increase the reading speed by 30%.

### Use pronunciation to assist reading

Practice eye and brain synchronization.

- Use voice assistance (Use the rhythm of silent reading to control the speed of eye scanning) to assist eye movement and brain coordination.
- When you see a familiar phrase, you can recognize it by reading two syllables and move on to the next one.

### Learn to skip reading

No need to read word for word. Experiments show that even if 10% of the text is cut out from a paragraph, basically all the information can be restored.

- Don't stop when you encounter a word you don't know, just jump to it.
